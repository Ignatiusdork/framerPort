        After my time at the university, majoring in{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Environmental Science and Engineering</span>, I decided to pursue my
        passion for programming. I researched and learned myself becoming self-taught{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">in software development and blockchain technologies</span>.{" "}
        <span className="italic">My favorite part of programming</span> is the
        problem-solving aspect. I <span className="underline">love</span> the
        feeling of finally figuring out a solution to a problem. My core stack
        are{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">
          React, Next.js, Node.js, and Solidity
        </span>
        . I am also familiar a little with TypeScript and SQL. I am always looking to
        learn new technologies. I am currently looking for a{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">full-time junior position</span> as a software
        developer.
        </p>

        <p>
        <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, I enjoy reading
        history, watching movies, listing to music, and hanging out with friends. I also enjoy{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">learning new things</span>. I am currently
        learning about{" "}
        <span className="font-medium">Greek and philosophy</span>. I'm also
        learning how to play the guitar.
